    NETWORK SECURITY A network security specialist is a professional who focuses on ensuring information confidentiality, integrity and availability. 
    Network security utilizes proactive techniques, including defense-in-depth and layered security, to mitigate or eliminate vulnerabilities in information systems and to protect against potential exploitation. This may include network and application penetration testing, software and hardware reverse engineering as well as developing exploits for identified vulnerabilities. 
    Security professionals possess intimate knowledge of critical business components. The Network Security degree reflects the application of theory and is aligned with industry standards and guidelines. It provides students with the opportunity to synthesize and apply the vital skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in the cyber security workforce. 
    <br>
    NETWORK SECURITY DEGREE OBJECTIVES  
    <br>
    1. Create a network infrastructure design communications document that includes identified hardware components, connections to outside world, identified physical layer connectivity (media) and addressing, including operational and security components in the design. 
    <br>
    2. Install, configure and test security hardware and software tools with supporting documentation such as port scanners, vulnerability detection systems, intrusion detection systems, firewalls, system hardening, anti-virus tools, patch management, auditing and assessment. <br>
